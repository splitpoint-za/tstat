------------
* updated erf.c so that also VLAN encapsulation over SDH should be correctly decoded
* experimental and quick patch that allows to read from two separate files 
  when using the ERF file formats. This is useful when using two separate trace 
  files (one file for each directions). To enable this, add the -2 switch, 
  and then pass two files at tstat, e.g., tstat -2 in.erf out.erf 
  Warning: the first file may be compressed, while the second one must not; 
  use a pipe to avoid this limitation.
