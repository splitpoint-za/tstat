News in 2.2
-------------
* Direct generation of compressed (.gz) logs and dumps
* Updated DPI classification:
  - Bittorrent uTP
  - Detailed YouTube characterization

   (RDD/Histograms)  for traffic to/from a specific range of 
   addresses ("cloud").

News in 2.1
-------------
* Bugfixes (see ChangeLog)
* Updated DPI classification:
  - Added SSL/TLS
  - Improved IMAP classification
  - Heuristics for identification of eMule/ED2K obfuscate TCP connections 
    and eMule/KAD obfuscate UDP flows 
  - Heuristics for identification of Bittorrent encrypted connections
  - HTTP flow content identification, based on the shallow matching of 
    the URL path:
     - Facebook
     - YouTube and other video download services
     - File Hosting services (RapidShare, MegaUpload, and other)
* New format for subnet file (-N)
* Changed bitrate RRDs and histograms from kbit/s to bit/s
* Improved detection of duplicated TCP/UDP segments 
* Improved identification of MPLS packets when using libpcap
* Included a MySQL db scheme and a few Perl scripts for Tstat Log analysis 
  (in scripts/MySQL/)

News in 2.0
-------------
* Added a Skype classification engine
* Added a Deep Packet Inspector - DPI classifier for application level
* Added support to create dump traces splitting the input traffic 
  w.r.t DPI classification
* Added a runtime module to enable/disable writing of traces and logs 
  without kill the Tstat process
* Added support for building Libtstat, a shared library that enable to 
  use Tstat features from external tools
* Added a new compact format for log files

News in 1.01
------------
* updated erf.c so that also VLAN encapsulation over SDH should be correctly decoded
* experimental and quick patch that allows to read from two separate files 
  when using the ERF file formats. This is useful when using two separate trace 
  files (one file for each directions). To enable this, add the -2 switch, 
  and then pass two files at tstat, e.g., tstat -2 in.erf out.erf 
  Warning: the first file may be compressed, while the second one must not; 
  use a pipe to avoid this limitation. 

News in 1.0
------------
* Integration with RRDtool
* Live analysis with libpcap and DAG interface
* multithread to support live analysis on high-speed links
* new measurement indexes
  o TCP out-of-sequence and duplicate classification
  o RTP/RTCP flow analysis
  o UDP flow analysis
  o other changes and tune-up 
* updated code to TCPTrace ver 6.6.x
* many bug fixes
* uniformed naming to English (possibly) language
* many more...
