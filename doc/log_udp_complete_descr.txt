Tstat produces a "log_udp_complete" file which logs every UDP possible flow 
pair tracked by tstat. 
By default, only P2P UDP traffic is logged here. UDP information for 
other application protocols (Skype, IM protocols, etc.) is logged in the
protocol own log_*_complete file. 
It's possible to log all the UDP traffic by defining LOG_ALL_UDP.

An UDP flow pair is identified when the first UDP segment is observed for a 
UDP socket pair, and is ended when no packet has been observed 
(from both sides) for UDP_IDLE_TIME microsec (defined in param.h). 
By default is set to 5 min.

Values are separated by spaces.

Each line is composed of two parts: values referring to the "client"
host (i.e. the host source of the first segment for the flow), 
and values referring to the "server" host (i.e. the destination of the first
segment of the flow).

Here it follows a brief description of the columns.
