Tstat produces a "log_streaming_complete" files which logs every HTTP Video
connection that has been tracked. Currently are classified as Video, 
HTTP connections based on 2 distinguished approaches:
1) Value of Content-Type information in the HTTP's header 
2) Signature matching in the video payload, to identify the video container. 
It is generated only if STREAMING_CLASSIFIER is defined. 

The log contains a subset of the data already reported in the TCP 
log_tcp_complete log, with additional columns that are mostly relevant for
the video characterization (duration,bitrate,size..).
For the semantics of the TCP connections and the meaning of the specific fields,
you can refer to the description for the log_tcp_complete file.

Here it follows a brief description of the columns.
