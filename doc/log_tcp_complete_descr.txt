Tstat produces "log_tcp_complete" and "log_tcp_nocomplete" files which log every TCP
connection that has been tracked.

A TCP connection is identified when the first SYN segment is observed, and
is ended when either:
  - the FIN/ACK or RST segments are observer;
  - no data packet has been observed (from both sides) for a default timeout 
    of 10s after the thress-way handshake or 5min after the last data packet 
    (see TCP_SINGLETON_TIME and TCP_IDLE_TIME in param.h);

Tstat discards all the connections for which the three way handshake is not 
properly seen. Then, in case a connection is correctly closed it is stored in 
log_tcp_complete, otherwise in log_tcp_nocomplete. 

Both files have the same format with values separated by spaces.
Columns are grouped according to C2S - Client-to-Server 
and S2C - Server-to-Client traffic directions. 

Here it follows a brief description of the columns.

Since the connection type is a bitmask, it's possible to have combinated
values. Common combinations are 257 (HTML and P2P), or 16640 (P2P and OBF).

These values are different from 0 only for identified HTTP connections 
(column no. 101). These constants are also used in the RRD data and in 
histograms (decreased by one so that HTTP_GET is 0 and HTTP_GMAPS is 13).
[*] HTTP_VOD connection identification is experimental and not valid for
usage outside Politecnico di Torino.
[+] HTTP_SOCIAL is a set of matchings tailored for Nasza-Klasa (PL) and IWIW
(HU). Since IWIW seems to be based on OpenSocial (http://www.opensocial.org/),
it should match also generic OpenSocial traffic. Probably not useful outside
Poland or Hungary.
[=] HTTP_FLASHVIDEO identify traffic from a few popular flash-based video
distribution sites.
[%] HTTP_YOUTUBE_204 and HTTP_YOUTUBE_VIDEO204 are counted as HTTP_YOUTUBE_VIDEO
in RRDs and histograms (i.e. they are classified in idx4 ). 
[~] HTTP_YOUTUBE_SITE_DIRECT and HTTP_YOUTUBE_SITE_EMBED are counted as HTTP_YOUTUBE_SITE
and WEB_OTHER in RRDs and histograms (i.e. they are classified in idx15 ). 
[$] HTTP_TWITTER refers just to Twitter unencrypted connections, mostly related to
the Twitter widgets in web pages. HTTP_TWITTER is counted as HTTP_SOCIAL and WEB_SOCIAL in 
RRDs and histograms (i.e. it is classified in idx16 ).
[^] HTTP_DROPBOX refers to the presence/keep-alive connections maintained by the
Dropbox client. Experimental. It is counted as HTTP_GET and WEB_OTHER in RRDs and 
histograms.
