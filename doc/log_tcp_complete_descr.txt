Tstat produces a "log_complete" and "log_nocomplete" files which log every TCP
connection that has been tracked by tstat.

A tcp connection is identified when the first SYN segment is observed, and
is ended when either
a) the FIN/ACK or RST segments are observer
b) no packet has been observed (from both sides) for IDLE_TIME microsec
(defined in param.h). By default is set to  1 min.

if the three way handshake succeeded and if the connection tear-down a
case) is observed, then a line in the log_complete file is added.
Otherwise, the connection is logged in the log_nocomplete file.

Both files have the same format. Values are separated by spaces.

Each line is composed of three main parts: values referring to the client
host, values referring to the server hosts, and flow information (time 
references and flow type).

Here it follows a brief description of the columns.

Since the connection type is a bitmask, it's possible to have combinated
values. Common combinations are 257 (HTML and P2P), or 16640 (P2P and OBF).

Some of these values are actually internally used for UDP only, 
or correspond to currently disabled alternate matching rules,
so they might never appear in log_tcp_(no)complete.
