Tstat produces a "log_video_complete" files which logs every TCP Video
connection that has been tracked. Currently are classified as Video 
the RTMP connections and the relevant HTTP connections (YouTube, Vimeo, generic
FLV/MP4, VOD and FlashVideo). 
It is generated only if VIDEO_DETAILS (and optionally HIDE_YOUTUBE_REQUEST_ID) 
is defined. 

The log contains a subset of the data already reported in the TCP 
log_tcp_complete log, with additional columns that are mostly relevant for
YouTube connections and other video streams.
For the semantics of the TCP connections and the meaning of the specific fields,
you can refer to the description for the log_tcp_complete file.

Here it follows a brief description of the columns.

[*] The YouTube video format is the 'fmt/itag' value indicated in 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#Quality_and_codecs 
Common values are 34 (360p FLV), 35 (480p FLV), and 22 (720p MP4).
[+] Duration and size are not reported for MP4 videos.
[=] Redirection type and redirection count are based on the redirection information in the videodownload URL:
    Redir_mode Redir_count  Comment
      	 0 	    0 	    No redirection indication
      	 1 	    X 	    URL parameter redirect_counter=X, no "st=" parameter
      	 2 	    X+1     URL parameter redirect_counter=X, parameter "st=tcts"
      	 3 	    X+1     URL parameter redirect_counter=X, parameter "st=nx"

      	 5 	    1       No "redirect_counter=" parameter, parameter "st=nx"
      	 6 	    X+1     Any other combination
    redirect_counter is set when the video is redirected (via "Location") from 
       v<X>.lscache<Y>.c.youtube.com address  to the corresponding tc.v<X>.lscache<Y>.c.youtube.com
       or to the corresponding v<X>.nonxt<Y>.c.youtube.com, 
       or when any request is redirected to v<N>.cache<M>.c.youtube.com
    st=tcts is set with redirect_counter when the (already redirected) request is redirected to
       a location-identified cache r<N>.<city><X>[gst]<Y>.c.youtube.com
    st=lc is set (with no redirect_counter parameter) when the lscache request is redirected to
       a location-identified cache r<N>.<city><X>[gst]<Y>.c.youtube.com
    st=nx is set (with or without redirect_counter parameter) when the nonxt request is redirected to
       a location-identified cache r<N>.<city><X>[gst]<Y>.c.youtube.com. nonxt<N> addresses
       are used for unlisted and private videos.
