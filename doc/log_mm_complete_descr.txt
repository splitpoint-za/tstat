*** October 2019 - -MMM- & MT
This is a working version of the document for the new v3 format for log_mm_complete, focused to
remove legacy information support and adapt it the latest RTP/RTCP classification in Tstat
Changes:
- Since we are logging separate stats for SSRC, connections are split (again, since v1), in multiple
  lines, one per SSRC.
- The protocol type would be useless, since we are currently supporting only UDP classification
- A mix of RTP/RTCP/DTLS/STUN/TURN/ZRTP is permitted over the same UDP flow, according to RFC7983, 
  and we track it in a bitmask
- We trace the multiple Payload Types for each SSRC, and count separately their packets (other stats
  are still per-SSRC)
- even/odd port requirements are relaxed for RTP/RTCP, but ports larger than 1024 are still required 
  (Netbios  port 137 would be a common false positive for RTCP)

The text below is mostly the original one, with corrections to remove TCP references.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tstat produces a "log_mm_complete" reporting statistics for the RTP and RTCP flows. 
The classification process exploits a finite state machine that perform checks 
of version field, sequence numbers and payload types. In particupar,
if in the first UDP packet:

* the version field is set to 2
* the payload type field has an admissible values (for RTP or for RTCP)
* the UDP ports are larger than 1024  

the flow is marked as possible RTP/RTCP flow (FIRST_RTP/FIRST_RTCP).
When the second UDP segment of this UDP flow (same IP/ports) is observed, 
then Tstat double checks if it still be interpreted as RTP/RTCP payload controlling if

* the version is equal to 2
* a subflow with the same ssrc is already present
* the seqno is the expected one for the ssrc subflow

If checks succede, then the flows is marked as RTP and its analysis may start.
Any time a new ssrc subflow is found, a new record is allocated for its stats.

For RTCP flows, a simpler heuristic is used:

* the version must be equal to 2
* the payload type must be a correct one
* the UDP ports are larger than 1024 and are even/odd for RTP/RTCP. 

If so, the flow is considered a RTCP flow and its analysis may start.

Due to the current multiplexing of several protocols over the same flow, the procotols are
currently classified as RTP+ (RTP_PLUS).

 No bit set (0) means "No protocol/Unknown", while the other bits are set to 1 when a packet for that type is registered for on the flow.
 Common values should be 1 (RTP), 3 (RTP/RTCP), 7 (RTP/RTCP/DTLS), 11 (RTP/RTCP/STUN), and 15 (RTP/RTCP/DTLS/STUN).
