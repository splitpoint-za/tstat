Tstat produces a "log_mm_complete" reporting statistics for the RTP and RTCP flows. 
The classification process exploits a finite state machine that perform checks 
of version field, sequence numbers and payload types. In particupar,
if in the first UDP packet:

* the version field is set to 2
* the payload type field has an admissible values (for RTP or for RTCP)
* the UDP ports are larger than 1024 and are even/odd for RTP/RTCP 

the flow is marked as possible RTP/RTCP flow (FIRST_RTP/FIRST_RTCP).
When the second UDP segment of this UDP flow (same IP/ports) is observed, 
then Tstat double checks if it still be interpreted as RTP/RTCP payload controlling if

* the version is equal to 2
* the same ssrc is present
* the seqno is the expected one
* the payload type is the same as before. 

If checks succedes, then the flows is marked as RTP and its analysis may start.


For RTCP flows, a simpler heuristic is used:

* the version must be equal to 2
* the payload type must be a correct one
* the UDP ports are larger than 1024 and are even/odd for RTP/RTCP. 

If so, the flow is considered a RTCP flow and its analysis may start.
