Tstat produces a "log_complete" and "log_nocomplete" files which log every
TCP connection that has been tracked by Tstat. Similarly, a
log_mm_complete file tracks downs all multimedia flows.

RTP tunnelled over UDP

Being it impossible to detect RTP/RTCP flows, a heuristic metodology has
been implemented. A state machine is used, to track RTP flows. At the first
UDP packet, it is labeled as "unknown".  For each new UDP flows, Tstat
double checks if the UDP payload may be an RTP/RTCP packet. This is done by
double checking that
- the version field is set to 2
- the payload type field has an admissible values (for RTP ot for RTCP)
- the UDP port is larger than 1024 and is even/odd for RTP/RTCP
if so, the flow is marked as possible RTP/RTCP flow (first_RTP/first_RTCP
status).

When the second UDP segment of this UDP flow (same IP/ports) is observed,
then Tstat double checks that it may still be interpreted as RTP/RTCP.
In the case of RTP flows, it checks that
- the version is equal to 2
- the same ssrc is present
- the seqno is the expected one
- the payload type is the same as before.
Then the flows is marked as RTP and its analysis may start
For RTCP flows, a simples heuristic is used:
- the version must be equal to 2
- the payload type must be a correct one
if so, the flow is considered a RTCP flow and its analysis may start.

For each RTP flow which is successfully tracked, a line in the
log_mm_complete file will be written when the flows ends.
